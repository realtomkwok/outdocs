              CSS “Always on the bottom” Footer I often find myself designing a
              website where the footer must rest at the bottom of the page, even
              if the content above it is too short to push it to the bottom of
              the viewport naturally. However, if the content is taller than the
              user’s viewport, then the footer should disappear from view as it
              would normally, resting at the bottom of the page (not fixed to
              the viewport). If you know the height of the footer, then you
              should set it explicitly, and set the bottom padding of the
              footer’s parent element to be the same value (or larger if you
              want some spacing). This is to prevent the footer from overlapping
              the content above it, since it is being removed from the document
              flow with position: absolute;.
